On average after 30 runs 

0.0000 for both 10 and 100
0.001 for 1000
printing process takes longer for 1000

from testing it seems that the program runs very quickly on smaller sets and still processes larger sets fast
however the printing process to display the larger sets is noticeably longer than with smaller sets
